# CANCER-DRUG-PREDICTOR
Developed a specialized AI tool that predicts how cancer cells respond to specific drugs based on their genetic expression. By bridging Genomics and Machine Learning, the project provides a scalable way to simulate treatment effectiveness, achieving a 97% accuracy rate (R^2 = 0.97%)
